OpenSight is an FRC-focused, free and open source computer vision system targeted specifically for the Raspberry Pi. Our goal is to make it easy for people not familiar with vision to be able to make complex pipelines, while also providing powerful functionality for advanced users.

## About

Our mission is to create an accessible vision suite, with an easy-to-use and works out-of-the box experience, but also allow for more power and greater customizability. We want to make vision more accessible to those with less experience, while also providing the tools for power users and developers to easily add features beyond the default modules.

## How it works
The main components of the OpenSight vision framework are the **modules** and the **pipeline**. 
Vision nodes can be connected to each other to form a vision pipeline which can detect and track targets. OpenSight comes with basic modules such as input from a camera, OpenCV image processing functions, and a FRC Camera Server implementation to show a camera stream on an FRC Dashboard such as Shuffleboard.

### Modules
The modules determine what the vision pipeline tracks and to what extent. OpenSight modules take after cv image operations, allowing the user to have much greater control over the vision pipeline.

A basic example of a common pipeline: 
**Camera Input** -> **Blur** -> **HSV Range** -> **Find Contours** -> **Find Center** -> 
**NetworkTables**

This of course is just a simple setup, and because an OpenSight pipeline can split into multiple paths, you can customize as much as you want, and even track multiple targets at once.

One unique advantage of OpenSight is its extendability. You can create your own module and with a simple pull request, make it available to any other team! [Here](https://opensight-cv.github.io/module-dev/intro/)
